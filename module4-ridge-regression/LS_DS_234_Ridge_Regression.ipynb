        "\n",
        "1. a solution exists,\n",
        "2. the solution is unique,\n",
        "3. the solution's behavior changes continuously with the initial conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are known as [well-posed problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem), and are the sorts of assumptions so core in traditional techniques that it is easy to forget about them. But they do matter, as there can be exceptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. no solution - e.g. no $x$ such that $Ax = b$\n",
        "2. multiple solutions - e.g. several $x_1, x_2, ...$ such that $Ax = b$\n",
        "3. \"chaotic\" systems - situations where small changes in initial conditions interact and reverberate in essentially unpredictable ways - for instance, the difficulty in longterm predictions of weather (N.B. not the same thing as longterm predictions of *climate*) - you can think of this as models that fail to generalize well, because they overfit on the training data (the initial conditions)\n",
        "\n",
        "Problems suffering from the above are called ill-posed problems. Relating to linear algebra and systems of equations, the only truly well-posed problems are those with a single unique solution.\n",

        "\n",
        "A lot of what you covered with linear regression was about getting matrices into the right shape for them to be solvable in this sense. But some matrices just won't submit to this, and other problems may technically \"fit\" linear regression but still be violating the above assumptions in subtle ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) is in some ways a special case of this - an overfit model uses more features/parameters than is \"justified\" by the data (essentially by the *dimensionality* of the data, as measured by $n$ the number of observations). As the number of features approaches the number of observations, linear regression still \"works\", but it starts giving fairly perverse results. In particular, it results in a model that fails to *generalize* - and so the core goal of prediction and explanatory power is undermined.\n",
        "\n",
        "How is this related to well and ill-posed problems? It's not clearly a no solution or multiple solution case, but it does fall in the third category - overfitting results in fitting to the \"noise\" in the data, which means the particulars of one random sample or another (different initial conditions )will result in dramatically different models.\n",

        "\n",
        "The `alpha` parameter corresponds to the weight being given to the extra penalty being calculated by [Tikhonov regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization) (this parameter is sometimes referred to as $\\lambda$ in the context of ridge regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "Normal linear regression (OLS) minimizes the **sum of square error of the residuals**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ridge regression minimizes the **sum of square error of the residuals** *AND* **the squared slope of the fit model, times the alpha parameter**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why the MSE for the first model in the for loop (`alpha=0`) is the same as the MSE for linear regression - it's the same model!\n",
        "\n",
        "As `alpha` is increased, we give more and more penalty to a steep slope. In two or three dimensions this is fairly easy to visualize - beyond, think of it as penalizing coefficient size. Each coefficient represents the slope of an individual dimension (feature) of the model, so ridge regression is just squaring and summing those.\n",
        "\n",
        "So while `alpha=0` reduces to OLS, as `alpha` approaches infinity eventually the penalty gets so extreme that the model will always output every coefficient as 0 (any non-zero coefficient resulting in a penalty that outweighs whatever improvement in the residuals), and just fit a flat model with intercept at the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, what we want is somewhere in-between these extremes. Intuitively, what we want to do is apply an appropriate \"cost\" or penalty to the model for fitting parameters, much like adjusted $R^2$ takes into account the cost of adding complexity to a model. What exactly is an appropriate penalty will vary, so you'll have to put on your model comparison hat and give it a go!\n",
        "\n",
        "PS - scaling the data helps, as that way this cost is consistent and can be added uniformly across features, and it is simpler to search for the `alpha` parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Bonus - magic! ✨\n",
        "\n",
        "Ridge regression doesn't just reduce overfitting and help with the third aspect of well-posed problems (poor generalizability). It can also fix the first two (no unique solution)!"

        "## And a bit more math\n",
        "\n",
        "The regularization used by Ridge Regression is also known as **$L^2$ regularization**, due to the squaring of the slopes being summed. This corresponds to [$L^2$ space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-integrable_function), a metric space of square-integrable functions that generally measure what we intuitively think of as \"distance\" (at least, on a plane) - what is referred to as Euclidean distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other famous norm is $L^1$, also known as [taxicab geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), because it follows the \"grid\" to measure distance like a car driving around city blocks (rather than going directly like $L^2$). When referred to as a distance this is called \"Manhattan distance\", and can be used for regularization (see [LASSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics%29), which [uses the $L^1$ norm](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-L1-and-L2-regularization-How-does-it-solve-the-problem-of-overfitting-Which-regularizer-to-use-and-when)).\n",
        "\n",
        "All this comes down to - regularization means increasing model bias by \"watering down\" coefficients with a penalty typically based on some sort of distance metric, and thus reducing variance (overfitting the model to the noise in the data). It gives us another lever to try and another tool for our toolchest!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Putting it all together - one last example\n",
        "\n",
        "The official scikit-learn documentation has many excellent examples - [this one](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols_ridge_variance.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-ridge-variance-py) illustrates how ridge regression effectively reduces the variance, again by increasing the bias, penalizing coefficients to reduce the effectiveness of features (but also the impact of noise).\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Due to the few points in each dimension and the straight line that linear regression uses to follow these points as well as it can, noise on the observations will cause great variance as shown in the first plot. Every line’s slope can vary quite a bit for each prediction due to the noise induced in the observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ridge regression is basically minimizing a penalised version of the least-squared function. The penalising shrinks the value of the regression coefficients. Despite the few data points in each dimension, the slope of the prediction is much more stable and the variance in the line itself is greatly reduced, in comparison to that of the standard linear regression\n",

        "- Revisit past data you've fit OLS models to, and see if there's an `alpha` such that ridge regression results in a model with lower MSE on a train/test split\n",
        "- Yes, Ridge can be applied to classification! Check out [sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier), and try it on a problem you previous approached with a different classifier (note - scikit LogisticRegression also automatically penalizes based on the $L^2$ norm, so the difference won't be as dramatic)\n",
        "- Implement your own function to calculate the full cost that ridge regression is optimizing (the sum of squared residuals + `alpha` times the sum of squared coefficients) - this alone won't fit a model, but you can use it to verify cost of trained models and that the coefficients from the equivalent OLS (without regularization) may have a higher cost"
