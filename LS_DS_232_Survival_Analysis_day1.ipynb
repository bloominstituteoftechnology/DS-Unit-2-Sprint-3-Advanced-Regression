    "\n",
    "Survival analysis was first developed by actuaries and medical professionals to predict (as its name implies) how long individuals would survive. However, it has expanded into include many different applications.\n",
    "* it is referred to as **reliability analysis** in engineering\n",
    "* it can be referred to more generally as **time-to-event analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general sense, it can be thought of as a way to model anything with a finite duration - retention, churn, completion, etc. The culmination of this duration may have a \"good\" or \"bad\" (or \"neutral\") connotation, depending on the situation. However old habits die hard, so most often it is called survival analysis and the following definitions are still commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* birth: the event that marks the beginning of the time period for observation\n",
    "* death: the event of interest, which then marks the end of the observation period for an individual\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "* Customer churn\n",
    " * birth event: customer subscribes to a service\n",
    " * death event: customer leaves the service\n",
    "* Employee retention\n",
    " * birth event: employee is hired\n",
    " * death event: employee quits\n",
    "* Engineering, part reliability\n",
    " * birth event: part is put in use\n",
    " * death event: part fails\n",
    "* Program completion\n",
    " * birth event: student begins PhD program\n",
    " * death event: student earns PhD\n",
    "* Response time\n",
    " * birth event: 911 call is made\n",
    " * death event: police arrive\n",
    "* Lambda School\n",
    " * birth event: student graduates LambdaSchool\n",
    " * death event: student gets a job!\n",
    " \n",
    "Take a moment and try to come up with your own specific example or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So... if all we're predicting here is a length of time between two events, why can't we just use regular old Linear Regression?\n",
    "Well... if you have all the data, go for it. In some situations it may be reasonably effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But, data for survival times are often highly skewed and, more importantly, we don't always get a chance to observe the \"death\" event. The current time or other factors interfere with our ability to observe the time of the event of interest. These observations are said to be _censored_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event is binary - so, while the time is continuous, the event itself is in some ways similar to a binary event in logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Censorship in Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a new cancer treatment is developed. Researchers select 50 individuals for the study to undergo treatment and participate in post-treatment obsesrvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Birth Event = Participant begins trial\n",
    "##### Death Event = Participant dies due to cancer or complications of cancer\n",
    "During the study:\n",
    "1. Some participants die during the course of the study--triggering their death event \n",
    "2. Some participants drop out or the researchers otherwise lose contact with them. The researchers have their data up intil the time they dropped out, but they don't have a death event to record\n",
    "3. Some participants are still be alive at the end of the observation period. So again, researchers have their data up until some point, but there is no death event to record\n",
    "\n",
    "We only know the interval between the \"birth\" event and the \"death\" event for participants in category 1. All others we only know that they survived _up to_ a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with Censored Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Without survival analysis, we could deal with censored data in two ways:\n",
    "* We could just treat the end of the observation period as the time of the death event\n",
    "* (Even worse) We could drop the censored data using the rationale that we have \"incomplete data\" for those observations\n",
    "\n",
    "But... both of these will underestimate survival rates for the purpose of the study. We **know** that all those individuals \"survived\" the \"death event\" past a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, in the 1980s a pair of smarty pants named David (main author Cox and coauthor Oakes) did the hard math work to make it possible to incorporate additional features as predictive measures to survival time probabilities. (Fun fact, the one named Cox also came up with logistic regression with non-David coauthor, Joyce Snell.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## lifelines\n",
    "It wasn't until 2014 that some other smart people made an implementation of survival analysis in Python called lifelines. \n",
    "It is built over Pandas and follows the same conventions for usage as scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Additional note: scikit pushed out a survival analysis implementation last year (2018) named scikit-survival that is imported by the name `sksurv`. It's super new so it may/may not have a bunch of bugs... but if you're interested you can check it out in the future. (For comparison, scikit originally came out in 2007 and Pandas came out in 2008)._"

    "The KM survival curve,a plot of KM survival probability against time, provides a useful summary of the data.\n",
    "It can be used to estimate measures such as median survival time.\n",

    "However it is a good way to visualize a survival dataset, and can be useful to compare the effects of a single categorical variable."

    "## The Intuition - Hazard and Survival Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hazard Function - the dangerous bathtub\n",
    "\n",
    "The hazard function represents the *instantaneous* likelihood of failure. It can be treated as a PDF (probability density function), and with real-world data comes in three typical shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Different hazard functions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Compsyseng17_04.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing and decreasing failure rate are fairly intuitive - the \"bathtub\" shaped is perhaps the most surprising, but actually models many real-world situations. In fact, life expectancy in general, and most threats to it, assume this shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the \"bathtub\" means is that - threats are highest at youth (e.g. infant mortality), but then decrease and stabilize at maturity, only to eventually re-emerge in old age. Many diseases primarily threaten children and elderly, and middle aged people are also more robust to physical trauma.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"bathtub\" is also suitable for many non-human situations - often with reliability analysis, mechanical parts either fail early (due to manufacturing defects), or they survive and have a relatively long lifetime to eventually fail out of age and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Survival Function (aka reliability function) - it's just a (backwards) CDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the hazard function can be treated as a probability density function, it makes sense to think about the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF). But because we're modeling time to failure, it's actually more interesting to look at the CDF backwards - this is called the complementary cumulative distribution function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In survival analysis there's a special name for it - the survival function - and it gives the probability that the object being studied will survive beyond a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![4 survival functions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Four_survival_functions.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see they all start at 1 for time 0 - at the beginning, all things are alive. Then they all move down over time to eventually approach and converge to 0. The different shapes reflect the average/expected retention of a population subject to this function over time, and as such this is a particularly useful visualization when modeling overall retention/churn situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ways to estimate/model survival analysis - terms to be aware of\n",
    "Key Components Necessary for these models - duration, and whether observation is censored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kaplan Meier Estimator\n",
    "- Nelson-Aalen Estimator\n",
    "- Proportional Hazards (Cox Model, integrates covariates)\n",
    "- Additive Hazards Model (Aalen's Additive Model, when covariates are time-dependent)\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most statistics, these are all refinements of the general principles, with the math to back them up. Software packages will tend to select reasonable defaults, and allow you to use parameters to tune or select things. The math for these gets varied and deep - but feel free to [dive in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) if you're curious!"

    "# Assignment - Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "Treselle Systems, a data consulting service, [analyzed customer churn data using logistic regression](http://www.treselle.com/blog/customer-churn-logistic-regression-with-r/). For simply modeling whether or not a customer left this can work, but if we want to model the actual tenure of a customer, survival analysis is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"tenure\" feature represents the duration that a given customer has been with them, and \"churn\" represents whether or not that customer left (i.e. the \"event\", from a survival analysis perspective). So, any situation where churn is \"no\" means that a customer is still active, and so from a survival analysis perspective the observation is censored (we have their tenure up to now, but we don't know their *true* duration until event).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to [use their data](https://github.com/treselle-systems/customer_churn_analysis) to fit a survival model, and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What features best model customer churn?\n",
    "- What would you characterize as the \"warning signs\" that a customer may discontinue service?\n",
    "- What actions would you recommend to this business to try to improve their customer retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please create at least *3* plots or visualizations to support your findings, and in general write your summary/results targeting an \"interested layperson\" (e.g. your hypothetical business manager) as your audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, as is often the case in data science, there isn't a single objective right answer - your goal is to *support* your answer, whatever it is, with data and reasoning.\n",

    "Good luck!"
